EODIE Documentation
====================

Purpose 
--------

EODIE is a toolkit to extract object based timeseries information from Earth Observation data.

The EODIE code can be found `here <https://gitlab.com/eetun-tiimi/EODIE>`_ .

The goal of EODIE is to ease the extraction of time series information at object level. Today, vast amounts of 
Earth Observation data are available to the users via for example earth explorer or scihub. Often, not the whole images 
are needed for exploitation, but only the timeseries of a certain feature on object level. Objects may be polygons depicting 
agricultural field parcels, forest plots, or areas of a certain land cover type.

EODIE takes the objects in as polygons in a shapefile as well as the timeframe of interest and the features (eg vegetation indices) 
to be extracted. The output is a per polygon timeseries of the selected features over the timeframe of interest.

Is EODIE suitable for me?
-------------------------

To use EODIE a general understanding of geospatial concepts is helpful.
You will need:

* Access to remote sensing data over your timeframe and area of interest (e.g. Sentinel-2/Landsat)
* A shapefile with polygons of your objects of interests

EODIE is particularly designed for people wanting to exploit timeseries information of raster remote sensing data without the need for dealing with particularities of the data itself.
EODIE produces human and machine readable csv files containing all information needed to start working with the data.
